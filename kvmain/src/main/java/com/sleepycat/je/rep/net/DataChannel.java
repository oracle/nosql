/**
 * An interface that associates a delegate socketChannel for network I/O, which
 * provides ByteChannel, GatheringByteChannel, and ScatteringByteChannel,
 * interfaces for callers.
 *
 * <p> The interface supports both blocking/non-blocking socketChannel as well
 * as normal and SSL connection, which complicates the semantics of its
 * methods.
 *
 * <h2 id="asyncIO">Asynchronous IO operation incompletion and
 * continuation</h2>
 *
 * For a non-blocking channel, the {@link #read}, {@link #write}, {@link
 * #flush} and {@link #closeAsync} methods may be incomplete due to some
 * requirements not met, e.g., channel write is busy or certain handshake steps
 * have not yet done for SSL. If the {@link #read} and {@link #write} methods
 * return {@code 0}, the operation may be incomplete. The {@link #flush} and
 * {@link closeAsync} methods return {@code false} if incomplete. The
 * application should call {@link getAsyncIOContinueAction} to determine what
 * action to take. When the action finishes, the operation should be retried.
 *
 * <h2 id="flush">Flushing the channel</h2>
 *
 * For a blocking channel, the data {@linkplain #write written} is always
 * flushed. For a non-blocking channel, the {@link #write} method only flushes
 * data when necessary. The application should call {@link flush} (multiple
 * times if neccessary to ensure its completion) to make sure the written data
 * is flushed.
 *
 * <h2 id="close">Closing the channel</h2>
 *
 * The channel supports methods to close gracefully for both {@linkplain #close
 * blocking} and {@linkplain #closeAsync non-blocking} channel. A method to
 * {@linkplain #closeForcefully close forcefully} is also provided.
 *
 * When any of the close method is called, if there is any thread concurrently
 * under an I/O operation (blocking or non-blocking) upon this channel, the
 * thread will receive an {@link AsynchronousCloseException} and the channel
 * will be closed forcefully.
 *
 * The channel is closed if any of the following occurs: (1) any of the close
 * method is called and throws exception; (2) the methods {@link close} or
 * {@link closeForcefully} return successfully; or (3) the method {@link
 * closeAsync} returns {@code true}. Any I/O operation upon the channel throws
 * {@link ClosedChannelException} after the channel is closed.
