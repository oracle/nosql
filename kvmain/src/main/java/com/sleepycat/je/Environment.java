/**
 * A database environment.  Environments include support for some or all of
 * caching, locking, logging and transactions.
 *
 * <p>To open an existing environment with default attributes the application
 * may use a default environment configuration object or null:
 * <blockquote>
 *     <pre>
 *      // Open an environment handle with default attributes.
 *     Environment env = new Environment(home, new EnvironmentConfig());
 *     </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * or
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     Environment env = new Environment(home, null);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>To create an environment or customize attributes, the application should
 * customize the configuration class. For example:</p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     EnvironmentConfig envConfig = new EnvironmentConfig();
 *     envConfig.setTransactional(true);
 *     envConfig.setAllowCreate(true);
 *     envConfig.setCacheSize(1000000);
 *     Environment newlyCreatedEnv = new Environment(home, envConfig);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Note that environment configuration parameters can also be set through
 * the &lt;environment home&gt;/je.properties file. This file takes precedence
 * over any programmatically specified configuration parameters so that
 * configuration changes can be made without recompiling. Environment
 * configuration follows this order of precedence:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Configuration parameters specified in
 * &lt;environment home&gt;/je.properties take first precedence.
 * <li> Configuration parameters set in the EnvironmentConfig object used at
 * Environment construction e   tameters not set by the application are set to
 * system defaults, described along with the parameter name String constants
 * in the EnvironmentConfig class.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>An <em>environment handle</em> is an Environment instance. Only one
 * Environment object may access a single environment. To reopen the
 * environment after a fatal exception, for example, first call {@link #close}
 * on the old handle.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Environment handle should not be closed while any other handle
 * remains open that is using it as a reference (for example, {@link
 * com.sleepycat.je.Database Database} or {@link com.sleepycat.je.Transaction
 * Transaction}.  Once {@link com.sleepycat.je.Environment#close
 * Environment.close} is called, such objects may not be accessed again.</p>

     * <p>When the environment handle is closed, allocated resources are

     * For example, if the cleaner is still cleaning the log, it will be
     * stopped at the next reasonable opportunity and perform no more cleaning
     * operations. After stopping background threads, a final checkpoint is
     * performed by this method, in order to reduce the time to recover the
     * next time the environment is opened.</p>
     *
     * <p>When minimizing recovery time is desired, it is often useful to stop

     * checkpoint. This prevents log cleaning from dirtying the Btree, which
     * can make the final checkpoint larger (and recovery time longer). The

     *
     * <pre>
     *     // Stop/finish all application operations that are using JE.
     *     ...

     *     env.checkpoint(new CheckpointConfig().setForce(true));
     *
     *     // Finally, close the environment.
     *     env.close();
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>The Environment handle should not be closed while any other handle
     * that refers to it is not yet closed; for example, database environment
     * handles must not be closed while database handles remain open, or
     * transactions in the environment have not yet committed or aborted.
     * Specifically, this includes {@link com.sleepycat.je.Database Database},
     * and {@link com.sleepycat.je.Transaction Transaction} handles.</p>
     *
     * <p>If this handle has already been closed, this method does nothing and
     * returns without throwing an exception.</p>
     *
     * <p>In multithreaded applications, only a single thread should call
     * Environment.close.</p>
     *
     * <p>The environment handle may not be used again after this method has
     * been called, regardless of the method's success or failure, with one

     * to discard references from closed objects to the allocated memory for an

     * <p>
     * For a non-replicated DB, an auto-commit txn must be created by calling
     * LockerFactory.getWritableLocker with the autoTxnIsReplicated param set
     * to false.  If autoTxnIsReplicated is set to true in a replicated

     * unknown state, the consistency checks would fail and prevent performing
     * the operation on the local/non-replicated DB.
     * <p>
     * Unfortunately, we need to create a txn/locker in order to query the DB
     * metadata, to determine whether it is replicated.  Therefore, we always
     * attempt the operation initially with autoTxnIsReplicated set to false.
     * The DbTree name operation methods (see DbTree.lockNameLN) will throw an
     * internal exception (NeedRepLockerException) if a non-replicated
     * auto-commit txn is used on a replicated DB.  That signals this class to
     * retry the operation with autoTxnIsReplicated set to true.
     * <p>
     * Via an unlikely series of DB renaming it is possible that on the 2nd try
     * with a replicated txn, we find that the DB is non-replicated.  However,
     * there is little harm in proceeding, since the consistency check is
     * already done.

     * Checkpoints occur periodically and when the environment is closed.</p>
     *
     * <p>The intended use case for the {@code cleanLog} method is "batch
     * cleaning". This is when the application disables the cleaner threads
     * (using the {@link EnvironmentConfig#ENV_RUN_CLEANER} property)
     * for maximum performance during active periods, and calls {@code
     * cleanLog} during periods when the application is quiescent or less
     * active than usual. Similarly, there may be times when an application
     * wishes to perform cleaning explicitly until the target utilization
     * rather than relying on the cleaner's background threads. For example,
     * some applications may wish to perform batch cleaning prior to closing
     * the environment, to reclaim as much disk space as possible at that
     * time.</p>
     *
     * <p>To clean until the target utilization is reached, {@code
     * cleanLogFile} can be called in a loop until it returns {@code false}.
     * When {@link EnvironmentStats#getCurrentMinUtilization current
     * utilization} is significantly below the target utilization or the
     * target utilization cannot be reached (see
     * <a href="EnvironmentStats.html#cleaner">Cleaner Statistics</a>), the
     * application may wish to limit the amount of cleaning. Batch cleaning
     * can be aborted simply by breaking out of the loop. The cleaning of a
     * single file is not a long operation; it should normally take less than
     * one minute. For example:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     *     boolean cleaningAborted;
     *     boolean anyCleaned = false;
     *
     *     while (!cleaningAborted &amp;&amp; env.cleanLogFile()) {
     *         anyCleaned = true;
     *     }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Note that in certain unusual situations the cleaner may not be able
     * to make forward progress and the target utilization will never be
     * reached. For example, this can occur if the target utilization is set
     * too high or checkpoints are performed too often. To guard against
     * cleaning "forever", the application may wish to cancel the batch
     * cleaning (break out of the loop) when the cleaning time or number of
     * files cleaned exceeds some reasonable limit.</p>
     *
     * <p>As mentioned above, the cleaned log files will not be deleted until
     * the next full checkpoint. If the application wishes to reclaim this disk
     * space as soon as possible, an explicit checkpoint may be performed after
     * the batch cleaning operation. For example:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     *     if (anyCleaned) {
     *         env.checkpoint(new CheckpointConfig().setForce(true));
     *     }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>However, even an explicit checkpoint is not guaranteed to delete the
     * cleaned log files. See <a href="EnvironmentStats.html#cleaner">Cleaner
     * Statistics</a> for more information.</p>
     *
     * <p>When closing the environment and minimizing recovery time is desired
     * (see {@link #close}), as well as reclaiming disk space, the recommended
     * procedure is as follows:</p>

     * <pre>
     *     // Stop/finish all application operations that are using JE.
     *     ...
     *
     *     // Stop the cleaner daemon threads.
