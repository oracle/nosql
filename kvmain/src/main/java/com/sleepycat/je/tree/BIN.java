/**
 * A BIN represents a Bottom Internal Node in the JE tree.
 *
 * BIN-deltas
 * ==========
 * A BIN-delta is a BIN with the non-dirty slots omitted. A "full BIN", OTOH
 * contains all slots.  On disk and in memory, the format of a BIN-delta is the
 * same as that of a BIN.  In memory, a BIN object is actually a BIN-delta when
 * the BIN-delta flag is set (IN.isBINDelta).  On disk, the NewBINDelta log
 * entry type (class BINDeltaLogEntry) is the only thing that distinguishes it
 * from a full BIN, which has the BIN log entry type.
 *
 * BIN-deltas provides two benefits: Reduced writing and reduced memory usage.
 *
 * Reduced Writing
 * ---------------
 * Logging a BIN-delta rather a full BIN reduces writing significantly.  The
 * cost, however, is that two reads are necessary to reconstruct a full BIN
 * from scratch.  The reduced writing is worth this cost, particularly because
 * less writing means less log cleaning.
 *
 * A BIN-delta is logged when 25% or less (configured with EnvironmentConfig
 * TREE_BIN_DELTA) of the slots in a BIN are dirty. When a BIN-delta is logged,
 * the dirty flag is cleared on the the BIN in cache.  If more slots are
 * dirtied and another BIN-delta is logged, it will contain all entries dirtied
 * since the last full BIN was logged.  In other words, BIN-deltas are
 * cumulative and not chained, to avoid reading many (more than two) log
 * entries to reconstruct a full BIN.  The dirty flag on each slot is cleared
 * only when a full BIN is logged.
 *
 * In addition to the cost of fetching two entries on a BIN cache miss, another
 * drawback of the current approach is that dirtiness propagates upward in the
 * Btree due to BIN-delta logging, causing repeated logging of upper INs.  The
 * slot of the parent IN contains the LSN of the most recent BIN-delta or full
 * BIN that was logged.  A BINDeltaLogEntry in turn contains the LSN of the
 * last full BIN logged.
 *
 *   In JE 6, deltas were also maintained in the Btree cache.  This was done to
 *   provide the reduced memory benefits described in the next section.  The
 *   log format for a delta was also changed.  The OldBINDelta log format used 
 *   to be different. Its log entry type name is still BINDelta, 
 *   which is why the new type is named NewBINDelta (for backward compatibility,
 *   log entry type names cannot be changed). This is also why the spelling 
 *   "BIN-delta" is used to refer to deltas in the new approach. The old 
 *   BINDelta class was renamed to OldBINDelta and there is no longer a class
 *   named BINDelta.
 *
 * Reduced Memory Usage
 * --------------------
 * In the Btree cache, a BIN may be represented as a full BIN or a BIN-delta.
 * Eviction will mutate a full BIN to a BIN-delta in preference to discarding
 * the entire BIN. A BIN-delta in cache occupies less memory than a full BIN,
 * and can be exploited as follows:
 *
 *  - When a full BIN is needed, it can be constructed with only one fetch
 *    rather than two, reducing IO overall.  IN.fetchIN implements this
 *    optimization.
 *
 *  - Certain operations can sometimes be performed using the BIN-delta alone,
 *    allowing such operations on a given data set to take place using less
 *    less IO (for a given cache size).
 *
 * The latter benefit is not yet implemented.   No user CRUD operations are
 * currently implemented using BIN-deltas. In the future we plan to implement
 * the following operations using the BIN-delta alone.
 *
 *  - Consider recording deletions in a BIN-delta.  Currently, slot deletion
 *    prohibits a BIN-delta from being logged.  To record deletion in
 *    BIN-deltas, slot deletion will have to be deferred until a full BIN is
 *    logged.
 *
 *  - User reads by key, updates and deletions can be implemented if the key
 *    happens to appear in the BIN-delta.
 *
 *  - The Cleaner can migrate an LN if its key happens to appear in the
 *    BIN-delta.  This is similar to a user update operation, but in a
 *    different code path.
 *
 *  - Insertions, deletions and updates can always be performed in a BIN-delta
 *    during replica replay, since the Master operation has already determined
 *    whether the key exists.
 *
 *  - Recovery LN redo could also apply insertions, updates and inserts in the
 *    manner described.
 *
 *  - Add idempotent put/delete operations, which can always be applied in a
 *    BIN-delta.
 *
 *  - Store a hash of the keys in the full BIN in the BIN-delta and use it to
 *    perform the following in the delta:
 *    - putIfAbsent (true insertion)
 *    - get/delete/putIfPresent operations that return NOTFOUND
 *    - to avoid accumulating unnecessary deletions
 *
 * However, some internal operations do currently exploit BIN-deltas to avoid
 * unnecessary IO.  The following are currently implemented.
 *
 *  - The Evictor and Checkpointer log a BIN-delta that is present in the
 *    cache, without having to fetch the full BIN.
 *
 *  - The Cleaner can use the BIN-delta to avoid fetching when processing a BIN
 *    log entry (delta or full) and the BIN is not present in cache,
 *
 * To support BIB-delta-aware operations, the IN.fetchIN() and IN.getTarget()
 * methods may return a BIN delta. IN.getTarget() will return whatever object
 * is cached under the parent IN, and IN.fetchIN() will do a single I/O to
 * fetch the most recently log record for the requested BIN, which may be a
 * full BIN or a delta. Callers of these methods must be prepared to handle
 * a BIN delta; either doing their operation directly on the delta, if
 * possible, or mutating the delta to a full BIN by calling
 * BIN.mutateToFullBIN().

     *
     * If the slot containing the identifier is removed or a new key with a
     * smaller value is added, the identifier key will be changed to the key
     * in the first remaining slot.
     *
     * Normally when a slot is removed, the IN is dirtied. However, during
     * compression the BIN is not dirtied when a slot is removed. This is safe
     * for the reasons described below. Note that the BIN being compressed is
     * always a full BIN, not a delta.
     *
     *  + If the BIN is not dirty and it does not become dirty before shutdown,
     *  i.e., it is not logged, then it is possible that this compression will
     *  be "lost". However, the state of the slot on disk is expired/deleted,
     *  and when the BIN is later fetched from disk, this state will be
     *  restored and the compression will be performed again.
     *
     *  + If the slot is dirty, the BIN may also be dirty or may become dirty
     *  later, and be logged. Logging a delta would cause the information in
     *  the dirty slot to be lost. Therefore, when a dirty slot is removed, we
     *  set a flag that prohibits the next BIN logged from being a delta.
     *
     * This optimization (that we don't dirty the BIN and we allow logging a
     * delta after removing a non-dirty slot) has one minor and one major
     * impact:
     *
     * 1. When a slot is removed for a deleted record, normally the slot and
     * the BIN will be dirty. Although it is unusual, we may encounter a
     * non-dirty slot for a deleted record. This happens if the slot could not
     * be removed by this method when a full BIN is logged, due to a lock or a
     * cursor, and we compress the full BIN later.
     *
     * 2. When a slot is removed for an expired record, it is common that the
     * slot will not be be dirty. In this case, without the optimization, the
     * removal of expired slots would cause more logging and less deltas would
     * be logged.
     *
     * @return true if all deleted and expired slots were compressed, or false

             *    will skip the record. Note that the compressor uses
             *    non-blocking locking.
             *
             *  + If expiration has been disabled, or the system clock has been
             *    changed, slots that were expired originally may not be
             *    expired now.
             *
             * Therefore, in all cases we enlarge the BIN if necessary to hold
             * all slots to be inserted when applying the delta. An extra slot
             * is added if leaveFreeSlot is true, to handle cases
             * where mutation to a full BIN is performed after calling
