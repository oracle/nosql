 *  single locker is used for read-committed isolation:
 *  - Cursor and CursorImpl should be collapsed into a single class.
 *  - Get rid of retainNonTxnLocks mode and just use BasicLocker for this
 *    behavior; use ThreadLocker to get retainNonTxnLocks=false behavior for
 *    internal ops.
 *  - A simplification similar to the read-committed simplification should be
 *    done for read-uncommitted, but in this case it should only be specified
 *    using LockMode.READ_UNCOMMITTED and we should remove the ReadUncommitted

     *     <li>Half the latching or less is needed. In the uncontended case,
     *     the BIN latch is only acquired once.</li>
     *     <li>There is less lock processing because there is only one call to
     *     lockLN.</li>
     *     <li>Most importantly, a blind deletion (using the BIN-delta alone)
     *     can be performed under the conditions described below.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Blind deletion is used only for secondary DBs, since we can assume
     * the presence of the key in the full BIN because secondary LN is
     * deleted only when its key is present in the old primary LN but not in
     * the new primary LN. We can use the BIN-delta bloom filter to detect
     * integrity errors, although this does not detect 100% of such
     * errors.</p>
     *
     * <p>Also, processing of aborts after a blind deletions is currently only
     * possible for secondary DBs. No abort information is logged with the
     * LN deletion, because no information about the existing record is known.
     * The usual abort information is listed below along with the reason it
     * not needed.</p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Key: Always the same as the key logged by the deletion
     *     because {@link DatabaseImpl#allowBlindDeletions} returns false if a
     *     partial comparator is used. Partial comparators must be used with
     *     mutable key values.</li>
     *     <li>Embedded data: Always empty for a secondary record, which
     *     contains a two-part key and no data.</li>
     *     <li>VLSN: Only used for replication because if-version ops only
     *     apply to primary records. Not stored in the BIN.</li>
     *     <li>Modification time: Always zero for secondary records.</li>
     *     <li>Last logged size: Not used for secondaries because the LN is
     *     not fetched or counted obsolete (it is immediately obsolete). Not
     *     stored in the BIN.</li>
     *     <li>Tombstone flag: Always false for a secondary record.</li>
     *     <li>Known/PendingDeleted flags: Must be false since an existing
     *     record is being deleted.</li>
     *     <li>LSN: The old LSN is lost, but the new (deletion) LSN can
     *     take its place as a unique lock ID. The LSN is never used for
     *     fetching in a secondary DB. See {@code RecoveryManager.undo}.</li>
     *     <li>Expiration time: This value must be restored by abort, but
     *     fortunately we can use the oldExpirationTime param.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Note that logging a blind deletion is possible only because we know
     * that no locks are held on the existing record. If the record were
     * locked by another txn, we would not be able to wait for a lock here
     * because we don't know the LSN. A guarantee that the prior version is
     * not locked is made by {@link BIN#isEvictable} as described further
     * below.</p>
     *
     * <p>Blind deletion is not used when a DB is not {@link
     * DatabaseImpl#isLNImmediatelyObsolete immediately obsolete}, which means
     * it must be a duplicates DB and a {@link PartialComparator} must not be
     * configured. This is necessary because the lastLoggedSize and abortLsn
     * are not available when performing a blind deletion, and these would
     * otherwise be necessary to perform obsolete counting. Additionally,
     * {@code PartialComparator}s would not work because the existing key
     * value would be needed to used as the abort key.</p>
     *
     * <p>Blind deletion is not used when we cannot call {@link
     * DbType#createDeletedLN} for this DB, because we would have to read the
     * existing record to create the deleted LN.</p>
     *
     * <p>Most of the conditions above are checked by {@link
     * DatabaseImpl#allowBlindDeletions}. We are also guaranteed that no
     * lock is held on a record that is not present in a BIN-delta. This is
     * because {@link BIN#isEvictable} returns false to prevent eviction
     * and mutation to a full BIN when {@code
     * DatabaseImpl.allowBlindDeletions} returns true, and a record lock is
     * held. Therefore, we don't need to acquire a write-lock to perform a
     * blind deletion.</p>
     *
     * @param oldExpirationTime is the expiration time of the primary record
     * that was deleted, which is stored in the deletion LNs for the primary
     * and the secondary records. It is available on the master during the
     * deletion, and is available in the secondary LN log entry during replica
     * replay. Note that the expiration time in the LNLogEntry for deletions
     * is simply a copy of the expiration time of the deleted record.
     *
     * @param allowBlindDelete should be true only if the caller knows that
     * the record exists, e.g., for secondary deletions and replica replay.
     *
     * @return OperationResult if the key is found and deleted, or null if

     * 3. If S is defunct, the lock kind is NONE, and dirtyReadAll is false,
     * return null. This case corresponds to the READ_UNCOMMITTED LockMode.
     * The record in S is defunct, but the deleting txn may be active still,

     * potentially blocking lock, in READ_UNCOMMITTED mode we consider the
     * record to be non-existing and return null.
     *
     * 4. If S is defunct, the lock kind is NONE, and dirtyReadAll is true,
     * lock the record in READ mode. This case corresponds to the
     * READ_UNCOMMITTED_ALL LockMode, which requires that we do not skip
     * "provisionally defunct" records. There are two sub-cases:
     *
     *  4a. If dataRequested is true, we wait until the deleting txn finishes.
     *      In this case the READ lock is blocking. If after the lock is
     *      granted S is still defunct, release the lock and return null.
     *      Otherwise, release the lock and return the LockStanding obj.
     *
     *  4b. If dataRequested is false, then we check whether the deleting txn is
     *      still open by requested a non-blocking READ lock. If the lock is
     *      granted then the writing txn is closed or this cursor's locker is
     *      the writer, and we proceed as if the READ lock was granted in 4a.
     *      If the lock is denied then the deleting txn is still open, and we
     *      return the LockStanding obj so that the record is not skipped.
     *
     * The BIN must be latched on entry and is latched on exit.
     *
     * @param dirtyReadAll is true if using LockMode.READ_UNCOMMITTED_ALL.
     *
     * @param dataRequested is true if the read operation should return the
     * record data, meaning that a blocking lock must be used for dirtyReadAll.

     *
     * Preconditions: The BIN must be latched.
     *
     * Postconditions: The BIN is latched.
     *
     * LN Locking Rules
     * ----------------
     * The lock ID for an LN is its LSN in the parent BIN slot.  Because the
     * LSN changes when logging the LN, only two methods of locking an LN may
     * be used to support concurrent access:
     *
     * 1. This method may be called to lock the old LSN.  For read operations,
     * that is all that is necessary.  For write operations, the new LSN must
     * be locked after logging it, which is done by all the LN logging methods.
     * Be sure to pass a non-null locker to the LN logging method to lock the
     * LN, unless locking is not desired.
     *
     * 2. A non-blocking lock may be obtained on the old LSN (using
     * Locker.nonBlockingLock rather than this method), as long as the lock is
     * released before the BIN latch is released.  In this case a null locker
     * is passed to the LN logging method; locking the new LSN is unnecessary
     * because no other thread can access the new LSN until the BIN latch is
     * released.
     *
     * The first method is used for all user operations.  The second method is
     * used by the cleaner, and by certain btree operations.
     *
     * Uncontended Lock Optimization
     * -----------------------------
     * The allowUncontended param is passed as true for update and delete
     * operations as an optimization for the case where no lock on the old LSN
     * is held by any locker.  In this case we don't need to lock the old LSN
     * at all, as long as we log the new LSN before releasing the BIN latch.
     *
     * 1. Latch BIN
     * 2. Determine that no lock/waiter exists for oldLsn
     * 3. Log LN and get lsn
     * 4. Lock lsn
     * 5. Update BIN
     * 6. Release BIN latch
     *
     * The oldLsn is never locked, saving operations on the lock table.  The
     * assumption is that another locker will first have to latch the BIN to
     * get oldLsn, before requesting a lock.
     *
     * A potential problem is that the other locker may release the BIN latch
     * before requesting the lock.
     *
     * This Operation        Another Operation
     * --------------        -----------------
     *                       Latch BIN, get oldLsn, release BIN latch
     * Step 1 and 2
     *                       Request lock for oldLsn, granted
     * Step 3 and 4
     *
     * Both operations now believe they have an exclusive lock, but they have
     * locks on different LSNs.
     *
     * However, this problem is handled as long as the other lock is performed
     * using a lockLN method in this class, which will release the lock and
     * retry if the LSN changes while acquiring the lock.  Because it
     * re-latches the BIN to check the LSN, this will serialize access to the
     * LSN for locking, guaranteeing that two conflicting locks cannot be
     * granted on the old and new LSNs.
     *
     * Cleaner Migration Locking
     * -------------------------
     * The cleaner takes a non-blocking read lock on the old LSN before
     * migrating/logging the LN, while holding the BIN latch.  It does not take
     * a lock on the new LSN, since it does not need to retain a lock after
     * releasing the BIN latch.
     *
     * Because a read, not write, lock is taken, other read locks may be held
     * during migration.  After logging, the cleaner calls lockAfterLsnChange
     * to lock the new LSN on behalf of other lockers.
     *
     * For more info on migration locking, see HandleLocker.
     *
     * Expired Record Locking
     * ----------------------
     * To support repeatable-read semantics when a record expires after being
     * locked, we must check whether a record was previously locked before
     * attempting to lock it. If it was previously locked, then it is treated
     * as not expired, even if its expiration time has passed.
     *
     * By was previously "locked" here we mean that any lock type is held, or
     * shared with its owner, by this cursor's locker. Since a read lock will
     * prevent modification of the expiration time, any lock type is adequate.
     * A shared lock is considered adequate to account for the case where
     * multiple lockers are used internally for a single virtual locker, as
     * seen by the user. This is the case when using a read-committed locker or
     * a thread-locker, for example.
     *
     * To avoid unnecessary added overhead, we do not check whether a record
     * was previously locked except when expiration is imminent, which is
     * defined as expiring within {@link
     * EnvironmentParams#ENV_TTL_MAX_TXN_TIME}. The ENV_TTL_MAX_TXN_TIME buffer
     * is used because the expiration time may pass while waiting for a lock.
     *
     * Another case to account for is when the expiration time of the record
     * changes while waiting for the lock. This can happen if the record is
     * updated or an update is aborted. In this case we can assume that the
     * was not previously locked, since that would have prevented the update.
     *
     * Note that when an uncontended lock applies, the expiration of the record
     * with the current LSN cannot change. It is possible that the update or
     * deletion requesting the uncontended lock will be aborted, and the LSN of
     * an expired record will be reinstated in the BIN, but this does not
     * create a special case.
     *
     * Historical Notes
     * ----------------
     * In JE 4.1 and earlier, each LN had a node ID that was used for locking,
     * rather than using the LSN.  The node ID changed only if a deleted slot
     * was reused.  The node ID was stored in the LN, requiring that the LN be
     * fetched when locking the LN.  With LSN locking a fetch is not needed.
     *
     * @param lockType the type of lock requested.
     *
     * @param excludeTombstones is true to cause tombstones to be considered
     * defunct/deleted.
     *
     * @param allowUncontended is true to return immediately (no lock is taken)
     * when no locker holds or waits for the lock.
     *
     * @param noWait is true to perform a no-wait lock request while keeping
     * the BIN latched.  The caller must check the lock result to see whether
     * the lock was granted.
     *
     * @return all information about the lock; see LockStanding.
     *
     * @throws LockConflictException if the lsn is non-null, the lock is
     * contended, and a lock could not be obtained by blocking.
