This package contains the code from the guava failureaccess.jar. It is included here because
of the possibility of integrations that include guava but not failureaccess. The code is
added vs including the library itself because the library has not changed in years and
Oracle corporate is uncomfortable with what looks like unmaintained 3rd party libraries.
By including the code it is implicitly maintained, even though it will never change.
<p>
At some point, when we're comfortable with the integrations, this code should be removed
as our system doesn't use Guava
