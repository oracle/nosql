/*
 * PartitionUnionIter is used for ALL_PARTITION queries in the cloud. For
 * such queries, the PartitionUnionIter is always the root iterator of the
 * server-side query plan. The algorithm used to execute such queries is
 * the following:
 *
 * A. Simple queries (no order-by, group-by)
 *
 * 1. Assume batch i starts execution at the driver.
 *
 * 2. The driver sends a request to the proxy. The continuation key (CKi) of
 * this request specifies (a) a partition Pi to be processed at some RN, (b)
 * the resume key RKi for Pi, and (c) a bitmap BMi with one bit per partition.
 * A bit is ON iff the corresponding partition was fully processed (all the
 * results from that partition were produced) during a previous batch (or
 * batches). Such a partition is said to be "done" (it will not be visited
 * again in this query). If i = 1 (the very first batch), Pi = 1, RKi is
 * null, and the bitmap has all its bits OFF.
 *
 * 3. The proxy (via its local RCV iter) forwards the request to an RN
 * containing Pi.
 *
 * 4. At the RN, the root PlanIter is a PartitionUnionIter. CKi is
 * represented by a ResumeInfo. ResumeInfo.theCurrentPid and
 * ResumeInfo.thePartitionsBitmap store Pi and BMi, respectively.
 *
 * 5. The PartitionUnionIter starts by asking the local topology for the ids
 * of all the local partitions. It stores this in theReqIds field.
 *
 * 6. Then, it starts executing the query sequentially on each not-done local
 * partition. The 1st partition to be processed in this step is Pi. Every
 * time a partition is fully processed, it is marked as done in the BMi
 * before moving on to the next partition. This step continues until the
 * batch limit is reached or all results from all local not-done partitions
 * are produced.
 *
 * 7. A new continuation key, CK(i+1), is constructed to be used for the next
 * batch. If the batch limit was reached during step 6, P(i+1) is set to the
 * partition that was being processed when the limit was reached and RK(i+1)
 * is set to the resume key of that partition. Otherwise P(i+1) is set to -1.
 * In both cases, BM(i+1) is BMi with the updates (if any) done to it during
 * step 6.
 *
 * 8. CK(i+1) and any results produced during step 6 are sent back to the proxy.
 *
 * 9. If the batch limit was reached during step 6, the proxy simply sends
 * CK(i+1) and the results back to driver, which returns them to the app.
 *
 * 10. If the batch limit was not reached, the proxy looks at BM(i+1) for a
 * not-done partition and sends a request to an RN that hosts that partition.
 * The batch limit for this request is set to the remaining limit. At the
 * RN this request is processed the same way as in steps 4-8.
 *
 * 11. Step 10 repeats until the full batch limit is consumed or all query
 * results have been produced (i.e., all bits in BM(i+1) are ON). The
 * proxy accumulates the query results produced by each proxy-RN request.
 * When done, it sends these results together with CK(i+1) to the driver.
 *
 * B. Sorting/grouping queries
 *
 * Sorting queries are executed in 2 phases. In phase 1, we make sure that the
 * driver caches at least one result per partition, except from partitions that
 * do not contain any results at all. During this phase, a request sent by the
 * driver to the store may access more than one partitions (as explained in
 * more detail below). Let R be the set of partitions that have at least one
 * result. At the end of phase 1, the driver will have a result queue and a
 * continuation key per R partition. In phase 2, the query driver merge-sorts
 * the locally cached partition results. When all cached results from some
 * partition are consumed, the driver requests more results from that partition
 * only (only a single partition is accessed during a phase 2 batch).
 *
 * A phase-1 batch is processed as follows:
 *
 * 1. The driver sends a request to the proxy. The continuation key (CKi) of
 * this request specifies (a) a flag PH1i telling whether the query is in
 * phase 1, (b) a partition Pi to be processed at some RN, (c) the resume key
 * RKi for Pi, and (d) a bitmap BMi with one bit per partition. A bit is ON iff
 * the corresponding partition is "done". In this case, "done" means that during
 * a previous batch, at least one result was generated from the partition or it
 * was found that the partition does not have any results at all. A "done"
 * partition will not be visited again during phase 1. If i = 1, phase 1 is
 * true, Pi = 1, RKi is null, and the bitmap has all its bits OFF.
 *
 * 2. The proxy forwards the request to an RN containing Pi.
 *
 * 3. At the RN, the query processor uses the local topology info and the BMi
 * to construct a set S of local, not-done partitions. It also constructs a
 * CKij for each S partition Pij, except Pi (whose CK is CKi). In each CKij,
 * the partition id is Pij, RKij is null, BMij is BMi, and PH1ij is true.
 *
 * 4. Then, it starts executing the query in a round-robin fashion on each
 * partition in S. The 1st partition to be processed in this step is Pi. Every
 * time a result is produced from a partition Pij, or Pij is found to have no
 * more results, Pij is marked as done in the BMi, before moving on to the next
 * partition. Furthermore, if Pij has no more results, CKij is set to null and
 * Pij is removed from S. This step continues until the batch limit is reached
 * or all results from all S partitions are produced.
 *
 * 5. A new continuation key, CK(i+1), is constructed to be used for the next
 * batch. Two cases are distinguished (a) If the batch limit was reached before
 * all S partitions were visited at least once during step 4, CK(i+1) is set to
 * the CKij of the partition that was being processed when the limit was reached.
 * (b) Otherwise P(i+1) is set to -1, RK(i+1) is set to null, and PH1(i+1) is
 * set to false. In both cases, BM(i+1) is BMi with the updates (if any) done to
 * it during step 4.
 *
 * 6. CK(i+1), all the CKij's, and any results produced during step 4 are sent
 * back to the proxy. The results are grouped per partition.
 *
 * 7. If case (5a) is true, the proxy simply sends CK(i+1), the CKij's and the
 * results to the driver.
 *
 * 8. If case (5b) is true, the proxy must determine if phase 1 is finished and
 * if not what P(i+1) should be. It does so by looking into BM(i+1) for a
 * partition that is not done yet. If one is found, P(i+1) is set to that
 * partition and PH1(i+1) is set to true. Otherwise, P(i+1) is left to -1 and
 * PH1(i+1) to false. Then, the proxy sends sends CK(i+1), the CKij's and the
 * results to the driver. Notice that in this case it may be that the batch
 * limit was not reached at the RN. However, for simplicity, the proxy will not
 * attempt to send another request to some RN.
 *
 * 9. The driver caches the received results and CKij's for the associated
 * partitions. If PH1(i+1) is true, the driver will initiate the next phse-1
 * batch using CK(i+1). Otherwise, it enters phase 2.
 *
 *
 * Handling topology changes:
 *
 * What happens if a partition moves to another shard while it is being
 * processed?. In this case, an ISE will be raised (because the partition DB
 * will be closed). The ISE will be caught and handled by the RequestHandler.
 * There are 2 cases: (a) The partition is the original partition Pi (the one
 * specified by the Request.partitionId field). In this case, the RequestHandler
 * will forward the Request to the RN that now stores partition Pi, where it will
 * be re-executed from the beginning. (b) The partition is not the original one.
 * The RequestHandler will again try to forward the Request to an RN that stores
 * the partition specified by Request.partitionId. The PartitionUnionIter cannot
 * change Request.partitionId, so it will still "point" to the original partition
 * Pi, not the current one. Unless Pi has also moved, RequestHandler will handle
 * this by throwing an RNUnavailableException, which will be caught by the
 * RequestDispatcher at the proxy. The RequestDispatcher will then retry the
 * Request from the beginning.
