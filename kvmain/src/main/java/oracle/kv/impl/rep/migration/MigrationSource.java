/**
 * Migration source thread. This thread will read records from the Db and
 * send them along to the target. It will exit when the reading of the Db is
 * complete or the migration is canceled.
 *
 * Partition DB Transfer (Partition scan)
 *
 * The initial data transfer takes place on the channel passed to the
 * constructor. The communication on this channel is one-way (source to target)
 * and consists of messages defined by the OP enum.
 *
 * {@literal
 *                               lastKey
 *               <-- "behind"       |       "ahead" -->
 *                                  V
 *   |-------------|*********************************|-------------|
 * lowest        first                             last          highest
 *  key         record   --- key-order scan -->   record          key
 * }
 *
 * In general, during the data transfer, lastKey is the current "position" of
 * the transfer. When a client operation comes it, its key is compared to
 * lastKey. If the key is less than lastKey, "behind" the transfer, the
 * operation is immediately sent to the target via the migration stream.
 * If the key is "ahead" of the transfer the operation is not immediately
 * sent since it will eventually be picked up by the scan. More details are
 * provided below.
 *
 * Transfer of Ownership (ToO)
 *
 * Once the transfer is complete, the source and target nodes participate in
 * the Transfer of Ownership (ToO) protocol to establish the partition at its
 * new location.
 *
 * {@literal
 * Transfer of Ownership (ToO)

 * 11 Update to TB                      Update to TB
 * 12 Stop RMW
 * }
 *
 * In #0 a No response to Done? is PENDING or RUNNING
 * In #9 a Yes response to Done? is SUCCESS
 *
 * Forwarded client operations at #4 will fail until the target reaches #7.
 *
 * After #7 the migration can not be canceled because the target partition
 * may have been modified by forwarded client operations and therefore is the
 * only up-to-date copy of the data.
 *
 * To cancel a migration the admin can invoke cancelMigration(PartitionId) on
 * the target. The admin can consider the migration canceled Iff the return
 * value is PartitionMigrationState.ERROR. When the migration is canceled, the
 * admin must then invoke canceled(PartitionId, RepGroupId) on the source
 * repNode.
 *
 * After #2 the source will monitor the target by periodically invoking
 * getMigrationState(). If PartitionMigrationState.ERROR is returned the source
 * will remove the record for the migration, undoing step #2 and effectively
 * canceling the migration on the source side. (see TargetMonitorExecutor)

     * achieved by synchronizing on this object.
     *
     * <h1>Coordination of Scan and Concurrent Client Operations.</h1>
     * The concurrent event of scan and client operations must also be
     * coordinated such that the order of the client operation is preserved.
     * That is, for the same key K,
     * (1) For two events (i) scan on K, corresponding to a send S1 and (ii) a
     * client operation on C, corresponding to a send S2. S1 must be ordered
     * before S2.
     * (2) For two client operations C1 and C2 on K, corresponding to S1 and
     * S2. If C1 commits to the database before C2, then S1 must be ordered
     * before S2.
     *
     * However, we do not want to put the scan (cursor) operation inside the
     * synchronization block for the send since that would greatly affect the
     * performance of the client operation.
