<BODY>
This package provides general fault handling and error catalog facilities. It
defines a consistent mechanism for exception and error handling by classifying
fault domains as being restricted to just a request or extending beyond the
request to the process level and handling them appropriately. It's always
desirable to constrain the impact of the an exception to the request domain,
since it minimizes its impact on the overall service. All faults handled
by this framework result in POJO <i>ErrorResponse</i> using the response model
specified by RFC7807. 
<p>
The framework provides for process cleanup and exit with well defined process
exit codes for process domain faults. While the process exit codes are generated
by the framework their handling is outside the scope of the framework.  Users of
this framework can supply their own process-level fault handling procedures,
based upon the process exit codes. For example, they can choose to alert a sys
admin immediately, or attempt to restart the process some pre-determined number
of times within a time interval before giving up and alterting a sys admin.
<p>
The framework can be extended by supplying appropriate overriding methods around
<p>

<h1>Class Descriptions:</h1>
<h2>RequestFault</h2>
Identifies faults (Exceptions or Errors) whose fault domain can be
restricted to the request that was being processed at the time the fault was
encountered. The server state is not impacted by the fault and the server can
continue processing other requests.<p>
<h2>RequestFaultException</h2>
A wrapper exception, implementing <i>RequestFault</i> used to wrap existing
exceptions when their fault domain is restricted to the request.<p>
<h2>ProcessFault</h2>
This interface, which is a subtype of RequestFault, identifies faults whose fault
domain extends beyond the request to the entire process. That is, the integrity
of the process servicing requests is questionable after encountering the
associated fault and the process must exit. Any exception that does not
implement RequestFault is treated implicitly as a ProcessFault with a predefined
HTTP response and process exit code. 
<h2>ProcessFaultException</h2>
A wrapper exception used to wrap existing exceptions or errors when their
fault domain is process level.<p>
<h2>RequestWrapper</h2>
This abstract class provides a centralized place to wrap every request
execution, so that exceptions can be handled in a consistent way. Subtypes
of this class can be used to provide request-specific behavior around the
wrapped request execution, for example, they can be used to provide logging
of requests.<p> 
<h2>ExceptionHandler</h2>
This abstract base class handles exceptions of request and process fault
domains. The exceptions thrown from <i>RequestWrapper.execute()</i> are
processed by this handler along with other exceptions that might be encountered
by the framework being used. Every exception is translated and mapped to a
POJO modeled according to RFC7807 used to build HTTP response payload. The
handler handles <i>ProcessFault</i> exceptions by additionally arranging for
the process to exit in response to the fault; the specifics of the process
cleanup and exit, are implemented by subclasses of this handler via the
<i>queueShutdown()</i> method.<p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Exceptions thrown from <i>RequestWrapper.execute()</i> should implement 
<i>RequestFault</i> or <i>ProcessFault</i> to clearly indicate the nature of
the fault; the wrapper classes <i>RequestFaultException</i> and
<i>ProcessFaultException</i> provide convenient implementation of these
interfaces. All other exceptions are typically considered to be unanticipated
errors and will result in the process being terminated.
<pre>
<code>
try {
...
} catch (IOException ioe) {
     throw new RequestFaultException(message,
         ioe, ErrorCode.UNKNOWN_INTERNAL_ERROR);
}
</code>
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Using <i>RequestWrapper</i> to wrap operation execution. Users of the abstract
class can specialize the behavior by defining the following methods that
are invoked around the call to the execute method: <i>requestPreExecute</i>
(before request execution), <i>requestSucceeded</i> (optionally after request
execution), <i>requestFailed</i> (optionally after request execution).
<i>requestPreExecute</i> is always executed. One of <i>requestSucceeded</i>
or <i>requestFailed</i> is executed based upon the disposition of the request.
Exceptions thrown by these methods are treated as localized <i>RequestFault</i>
internal server errors.<p>

createTable in oracle.nosql.sc.api.TMservice is a typical example using
<i>RequestWrapper.</i>.
<pre>
<code>
public class TMService {

    ...
    /**
     * Specialize the requestXXX methods, logging context of request.
     */
    private final RequestWrapper wrapper = new RequestWrapper() {

        @Override
        public <R> void requestPreExecute(SimpleRequest<R> request,
                                       RequestContext context) {
            logger.info("Start " + context.describe());
        }

        @Override
        public <R> void requestSucceeded(SimpleRequest<R> request,
                                      RequestContext context) {
            logger.info(context.describe() + " succeeded");
        }

        @Override
        public <R> void requestFailed(SimpleRequest<R> request,
                                   Throwable error,
                                   RequestContext context) {
            logger.info(context.describe() + " failed, " + error);
        }
    };

    @POST
    @Path("/tables/{tablename}")
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Response createTable(@PathParam("tablename") String tablename,
                                CreateTableInputs createTableInputs,
                                @Context HttpServletRequest request) {

        final String returnInfoPayload = wrapper.execute(
          (RequestWrapper.SimpleRequest<String>)() -> {
          ...
       },  new HttpRequestContext(request));
       ...
}

</pre>

<li>
Extend <i>ExceptionHandler</i> with specializing process shutdown procedure and
exceptions handling. <i>SCExceptionHandler</i> is a typical example used by
REST API services, it also extends javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper.
<pre>
<code>
@Provider
public class SCExceptionHandler extends ExceptionHandler
    implements ExceptionMapper<Exception> {

    @Override
    public Response toResponse(Exception ex) {
        final ErrorResponse payload = handleException(ex);
        final String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(payload);
        Response
            .status(error.getStatus)
            .entity(json)
            .type(APPLICATION_PROBLEM_JSON)
            .header("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate")
            .header("Pragma", "no-cache")
            .build();
    }

    @Override
    void queueShutdown(Exception exception, ProcessExitCode exitCode) {
        ...
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
Note that <i>handleException</i> in <i>ExceptionHandler</i>
translates <i>RequestFault</i> and <i>UnsupportedOperationException</i>, other
exceptions are all translated to a HTTP response with UNKNWON_INTERNAL_ERROR.
If subclasses need to handle other exceptions, override the method
<i>handleUnknownException.</i><p>

In addition, subclasses of <i>ExceptionHandler</i> must define process cleanup
and exit procedure in the method <i>queueShutdown</i> for handling process-level
faults.
