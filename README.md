Oracle NoSQL Database

Oracle NoSQL Database is designed for todayâ€™s most demanding applications that
require low latency responses, flexible data models, and elastic scaling for
dynamic workloads. It supports JSON, Table and Key-Value datatypes running
on-premise, or as a cloud service with on-demand throughput and storage based
provisioning.

Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service is now a fully managed database service
running on Gen 2 Oracle Cloud Infrastructure hardware.

## Prerequisites

- Java SE 11 or later installed on all Storage Nodes
  - Download and install a [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)
  binary release suitable for your system. See the install and setup
  instructions on that page.
- Maven 3.5.0 or later for build

## Build

The project consists of following modules

- kvmain (includes all source code. All other modules except kvtest fetch
  compiled classes from kvmain)
- kvstore (generates kvstore.jar)
- kvclient (generates kvclient.jar)
- sql (generates sql.jar)
- recovery (generates recovery.jar)
- kvtest (Parent module for all tests that run in `verify` phase)
  - kvstore-IT (All tests for kvstore, and all TestBase/Util classes, depends
    on kvstore.jar)
  - kvclient-IT (kvclient tests, depends on kvclient and kvstore-IT for compilation)
  - kvquery-IT (QTF tests, depends on kvstore, kvstore-IT and com.oracle.nosql.common:qtf)
  - kvdatacheck-IT (Datacheck unit test, depends on kvstore and kvstore-IT)
  - kvtif-IT (Text Index Feeder tests, depends on kvstore-IT)
  - coverage-report (Run jacoco coverage report)
- httpproxy (source code for NoSQL Httpproxy)
- packaging (generates shell jars and release packages)

To compile only the source code:

```bash
mvn [clean] compile -pl kvmain
```

`clean` is optional, it cleans the `target` folder before compile.

To compile with both source code and test code:

```bash
mvn [clean] compile
```

To build all KV artifacts and copy them with dependencies to a single folder:

```bash
mvn [clean] package
```

> [!NOTE] You can find the folder under `packaging/target/`. Above command will
build and package all modules, but it will skip tests execution by default.

## Running Tests

### Running tests for all modules

```bash
mvn -fn -PIT verify
```

The default test profile "IT" includes all test modules. It takes about 14-16
hours to run all tests.

### Running tests in sync mode

```bash
mvn -fn -PIT,sync verify
```

### Running tests for sub-modules

```bash
mvn -P it.kvstore verify
mvn -P it.kvclient verify
mvn -P it.kvquery verify
mvn -P it.kvdatacheck verify
mvn -P it.kvtif verify
```

> [!NOTE] It is possible to combine the test profiles.
> If you need to run both kvclient and kvquery tests, use:
> `mvn -P it.kvclient,it.kvquery verify`
